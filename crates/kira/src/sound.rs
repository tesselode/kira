/*!
Sources of audio.

Any type that implements [`SoundData`] can be played using
[`AudioManager::play`](crate::manager::AudioManager::play). Kira comes with two
[`SoundData`] implementations:

- [`StaticSoundData`](static_sound::StaticSoundData), which loads an entire chunk of audio
into memory
- [`StreamingSoundData`](streaming::StreamingSoundData), which streams audio from a file or cursor
(only available on desktop platforms)

These two sound types should cover most use cases, but if you need something else, you can
create your own types that implement the [`SoundData`] and [`Sound`] traits.
